# CHATBOT-WITH-RULE-BASED-RESPONSES
I developed this chatbot program to explore the fascinating world of artificial intelligence and natural language processing. The primary objective was to create an interactive tool that engages users in conversation while providing helpful information and assistance. Using Python, I implemented regular expressions to analyze user inputs, allowing the chatbot to understand a variety of topics, from greetings to inquiries about technology and geography.

The program features a diverse set of responses, ensuring that interactions feel dynamic and engaging. By incorporating random selection from predefined responses, the chatbot maintains a conversational flow, making each interaction unique. Additionally, it handles common inquiries, such as requests for help or expressions of gratitude.

This project not only showcases my programming skills but also reflects my passion for creating user-friendly applications. As I continue to refine the chatbot's capabilities, I aim to enhance its understanding and responsiveness, ultimately providing users with a more enriching and enjoyable experience.
